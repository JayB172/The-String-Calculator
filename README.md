# The-String-Calculator
Basically the String calculator is a calculator to calculate the expression written in string format.

## Tests:
1. If we pass an empty string as an input it will return the value 0.
2. The string with single number returns the number itself.
3. Two numbers seprated by comma (",") returns sum of that two numbers.
4. If we pass two numbers seprated by new line ("\n") it will also return the sum of that two numbers.
5. Three numbers delimited either ways will also return the sum of the input numbers.
6. The custom delimiters are allowed in between numbers.
7. Passing a negative number will throw exception and the value of negative inputs will be shown in the exception message.
8. The numbers greater than 1000 will be ignored while returning the sum.
